GEditPro is an advanced level editor for the Genesis3D engine. It is intended to replace GEdit, the old workhorse editor that was released with the original Genesis3D SDK in 1999.

GEditPro is a modification of GEdit and other previous editors developed by trilobiteWorks. And it is incomplete…

Basic tasks that still need to be performed include the following:
1. Help documentation.
2. Tutorials showing how to use the features included in this editor.

A few technical tasks that are still undone include:
1. More reliable texture locking for complex shapes.
2. Implementation of Multiple brush shear.

GEditPro was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio NET, specifically MS Visual C++ NET, and tested primarily in Windows XP Pro. It also has been tested and found to work in Windows 98 and Windows ME.

It is up to ambitious new programmers to find ways to make GEditPro better and more powerful. Use the provided source code, resources and MSVS NET Solution.

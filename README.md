Genesis3D Level Editor

The editor serves as a design tool for level designers, and as a place for
interfacing level art with the actual application. The level data is designed so
that artists and level designers can modify it easily, and programmers can
easily and efficiently access it at application run time.

When editing levels, you spend most of your time working with two different
item types:  *brushes* and *entities*.  By placing, shaping, and
changing attributes of brushes and entities, you can make very complex and
beautiful architecture.
